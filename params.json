{"name":"Linkscraper","tagline":"A PHP link scraper utility belt class","body":"LinkScraper - A PHP page scraping utility belt class.\r\n=====================================================\r\n\r\nExtract all A links from a page and optionally remove all of those\r\nthat are not 'on-site'. This is achieved by passing in the full URL to\r\nthe constructor, for example:\r\n\r\n    http://foo.bar.com\r\n\r\nwhich enables a simplistic check to know what's local and what isn't.\r\n\r\nLicence\r\n=======\r\n\r\nLGPL3. Do what you will with it but a link back would be nice and also\r\nknowing what you used it for is also of interest! Thanks. :)\r\n\r\n\r\nOperation and Use\r\n=================\r\n\r\nThis class implements the following interfaces: Iterator, ArrayAccess\r\nwhich means you can treat is just like an array m aking it very easy\r\nto process the links it finds at any given location.\r\n \r\nI have made it **immutable** once loaded. If you try to change the\r\ncontents of it after it has been loaded it will die. You can change\r\nthat if you want but I prefer not to change things once they are\r\nfixed, that's my 'functional' bias with PHP these days!\r\n\r\n \r\nTypical Usage:\r\n \r\n    $links = new PageSucker(\"http://google.com\");\r\n\r\n    echo $links[0];\r\n\r\n    $links[0] = \"something\"; // will die() as you cannot change its contents.\r\n \r\n    foreach ($links as $l) {\r\n        echo $l . '<br />';\r\n    }\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n## Typical Usage:\r\n\r\n    $links = new PageSucker(\"http://google.com\");\r\n\r\n    echo $links[0];\r\n\r\n    $links[0] = \"something\"; // will die() as you cannot change its contents.\r\n\r\n    foreach ($links as $l) {\r\n        echo $l .
